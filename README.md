RecycLink Project - README
==========================

Overview
--------
RecycLink is a full-stack recycling logistics platform designed to connect users with drivers for scheduled recyclable pickups. Inspired by gig-economy models like Uber and DoorDash, RecycLink provides real-time tracking, role-based dashboards, push notifications, and analytics to streamline the recycling process.

Features
--------
- User registration and login with role assignment (User, Driver, Admin)
- Pickup request submission with geolocation and scheduling
- Real-time driver tracking via SignalR
- Driver dashboard for accepting and managing pickups
- Admin dashboard for managing users, drivers, and requests
- Password reset and email verification flows with confirmation pages
- Push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- Dashboard analytics with Chart.js (user growth, driver activity)
- Avatar upload with preview and cropping
- Toast notifications for success, error, and backend-triggered events
